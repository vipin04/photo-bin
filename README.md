# Photo Bin

Is you phone's gallery filled with images of receipts, invoices, prescriptions etc, which are not necessarily the memories you want to capture forever?

This has been the case with me. It takes out the pleasure of exploring the past wonderful memories, if you need to consistently filter out the chaff from the wheat. 

Photo Bin is an iOS project which aims to build a Camera cum Gallery app that collects your scrap and keep it separate from main Gallery images. Photos taken on it won't be merged with your Gallery images.
Images will be stored in low resolution, sufficient for A4 printing and screen reading. (I don't think you would want your doc's prescription on a large poster, then why save it in high resolution format?)
